    <h1>Public Media Kitchen</h1>
    <p>There is too much duplication of effort in public media product development. We can do a better job sharing practices and things we build for ourselves that could be useful to others. The Public Media Kitchen Toolkit is a collection of interesting things we're all working on. The intention is first to inform but over time move to direct collaboration.</p>

    <h2>Toolkit</h2>

    <h3>Streaming Media</h3>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/StreamMachine/StreamMachine">StreamMachine</a></h4>
    <h5>Next-generation streaming audio infrastructure for radio stations.</h5>
    <p>StreamMachine is an open-source streaming audio server aimed at pushing innovation for radio stations that have spent too many years running old technology like Shoutcast and Icecast. The project has two goals: emulating the traditional streaming experience and building support for new features that push the radio listening experience forward. Currently StreamMachine supports traditional Shoutcast-style streaming and HTTP Live Streaming. SCPR has run StreamMachine in production since 2012.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/ProjectResound">Resound</a></h4>
    <h5>A suite of applications to help with the storage, management, and distribution of digital audio.</h5>
    <p>The goal of the project is that it's plug-and-play with existing systems, and is easy to use for any user in any given organization. This is a Knight funded project built by SCPR in collaboration with NYPR, WHYY, and NPR-DS.</p>

    <h3>Social Media & 3rd Party Platforms</h3>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/">Audiograms</a></h4>
    <h5>A library for generating shareable videos from audio clips.</h5>
    <p>Unlike audio, video is a first-class citizen of social media. It's easy to embed, share, autoplay, or play in a feed, and the major services are likely to improve their video experiences further over time. WNYC's solution to this problem was this library. Given a piece of audio to share on social media, this can generate a video with that audio and some basic accompanying visuals: a waveform of the audio, a theme for the show it comes from, and a caption.

    <h4><a href="https://company-102826.frontify.com/d/sln5eJoFXZ3B/89-3-kpcc-southern-california-public-radio">KPCC's Style Guide</a></h4>
    <h5>One guide to rule them all.</h5>
    <p>There's a branding problem at KPCC. Lacking a dedicated marketing department, their Product Designer created a universal style guide that will inform product design, but also branding across other departments.</p>
