      <p>There is too much duplication of effort in public media product development. We can do a better job sharing practices and things we build for ourselves that could be useful to others. The Public Media Kitchen Toolkit is a collection of interesting things we're all working on. The intention is first to inform but over time move to direct collaboration.</p>

      <h1>The Toolkit</h1>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/StreamMachine/StreamMachine">StreamMachine</a>: Next-generation streaming audio infrastructure for radio stations</h3>
        <p>StreamMachine is an open-source streaming audio server aimed at pushing innovation for radio stations that have spent too many years running old technology like Shoutcast and Icecast. The project has two goals: emulating the traditional streaming experience and building support for new features that push the radio listening experience forward. Currently StreamMachine supports traditional Shoutcast-style streaming and HTTP Live Streaming. SCPR has run StreamMachine in production since 2012.</p>

          <p>The goal of the project is that it's plug-and-play with existing systems, and is easy to use for any user in any given organization. This is a Knight funded project built by SCPR in collaboration with NYPR, WHYY, and NPR-DS.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/">Audiograms</a> A library for generating shareable videos from audio clips</h3>
        <p>Unlike audio, video is a first-class citizen of social media. It's easy to embed, share, autoplay, or play in a feed, and the major services are likely to improve their video experiences further over time. WNYC's solution to this problem was this library. Given a piece of audio to share on social media, this can generate a video with that audio and some basic accompanying visuals: a waveform of the audio, a theme for the show it comes from, and a caption. For more backstory, <a href="https://medium.com/@WNYC/e648e8a5f2e9">read this post</a>.</p>

        <p>There's a branding problem at KPCC. Lacking a dedicated marketing department, their Product Designer created a universal style guide that will inform product design, but also branding across other departments.</p>
