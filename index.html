    <h1>Public Media Kitchen</h1>
    <p>There is too much duplication of effort in public media product development. We can do a better job sharing practices and things we build for ourselves that could be useful to others. The Public Media Kitchen Toolkit is a collection of interesting things we're all working on. The intention is first to inform but over time move to direct collaboration.</p>

    <h2>Toolkit</h2>

    <h5>Next-generation streaming audio infrastructure for radio stations.</h5>
    <p>StreamMachine is an open-source streaming audio server aimed at pushing innovation for radio stations that have spent too many years running old technology like Shoutcast and Icecast. The project has two goals: emulating the traditional streaming experience and building support for new features that push the radio listening experience forward. Currently StreamMachine supports traditional Shoutcast-style streaming and HTTP Live Streaming. SCPR has run StreamMachine in production since 2012.</p>
