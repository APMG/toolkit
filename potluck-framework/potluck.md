# Potluck Conference
Based on survey results, we've found out that the following worked well for most attendees:
* two day conference
* Thursday and Friday worked out best for most attendees
* 3 x 1.5 hour sessions per day
* 30 minute breaks between sessions
* reminders or tips on how to prep for the sessions beforehand

For an example of how the day was structured, refer to the [January Potluck Schedule](https://publicmediakitchen.github.io/toolkit/public-media-potluck-january-2018.html)


## Instructions:
### 3 months before potluck
* agree on dates for the potluck
* agree on venue for the potluck
* book the venue for the potluck if it needs to be booked far in advance

### 2 months before potluck
* decide on a headliner session or overall topic
* change the link and blurb on [Public Media Kitchen Toolkit](https://publicmediakitchen.github.io/toolkit/) to refer to the new potluck. Date, location, and a new page [like this](https://publicmediakitchen.github.io/toolkit/public-media-potluck-january-2018.html)
* put as much logistical information as possible on the upcoming potluck page:
    * address/location
    * time and dates
    * headliner session or topic umbrella
    * lodging suggestions

### 3 weeks before the potluck
* put the daily schedule onto the potluck page
* put out last call for attendees to potluck
* decide who will be the note-takers for each session

### 1 week before the potluck
* finalize attendee list
* send an email confirming the potluck schedule
* send an email to anyone leading a session to confirm they have what they need

### two days before the potluck
* send an email re-iterating any logistics around the location of the Potluck (parking and walking tips, how to get into the building)
* confirm any dining arrangements with restaurants if necessary
* confirm that the conference site is set up (screens, dongles, wifi, chairs, snacks, water)

### the potluck
* act as the default facilitator for any sessions
* communicate any logistics around dining

### after the potluck
* compile all the notes and link to them from the potluck's schedule page
* send out a survey about the success or results of the conference
* collect survey results after 2 weeks
* share an overview of the results in an email with the conference attendees

## Protips:
* Put a breakfast slot in the schedule so that people planning to fly in day-of have a margin to work with.
* During Day 1's opening, collect or write down high level goals of the conference.
* It's easy to design hands-on coding sessions for developers, but product designers and product managers also would like hands-on sessions.
