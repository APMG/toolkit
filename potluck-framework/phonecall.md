# Potluck Calls
These biweekly calls serve as a way to keep the Public Media Kitchen community up to date with what everyone is working on, thinking about, or planning.  They should occur at the same time every other week and tackle different agendas each time.  Topics can be a more in-depth discussion about things that came up during the Potluck conference, or just things that come during the time between Potlucks.

The goal of the call is for discussion and not fussing with logistics, so ideally the calls are audio only and don't require video.  If visuals are needed for context, send a link to the visuals beforehand to all the interested parties so that they can view them on their own screen.

## Hosting calls
The hosting group of the upcoming potluck is expected to also host calls leading to the potluck.
