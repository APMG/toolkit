# Public Media Potluck

## What is it?
**potluck:** A semiannual conference or set of workshops where attendees come together for a few days to share, collaborate, and talk about products they've worked on or plan to work on. [more info](potluck.md)

**potluck calls:** A biweekly phone call where attendees dial in to talk and listen about specific topics. [more info](phonecall.md) 

## Who can attend
Anyone who is working in a hands-on capacity on a product or software development team at a public media organization.  This is for people on the ground who make the design mockups, create roadmaps, and write code.

Potluck is designed as a conversation between product teams. To ensure that value, we have to protect it from commercial interests and sales pitches.  There may be third parties interested in attending the calls or conference, but unless they are directly involved in public media, it's not recommended that they attend.

## Who can host
Anyone can host, but our goal is to rotate the location so that attendees have a chance to visit across the US.

Hosts are expected to:
* [organize and facilitate](facilitator.md) all calls leading up to the potluck they're hosting.
* organize communications around the calls
* communicate any logistics about the potluck leading up to the potluck

## Session suggestions
The following was collected from survey results after the January Potluck:

    * demos of products
