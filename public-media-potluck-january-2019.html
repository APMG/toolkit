        <h1>Public Media Potluck - 2019 - San Francisco</h1>
        <p>Build the next generation of Public Media together at the two day "Public Media Potluck". Share ideas, projects, and stories of success and failure with different public media product teams from around the country. Have a bigger impact by tackling issues facing public media organizations of all sizes and types of digital sophistication. This collective, coordinated effort will ensure you're solving problems that benefit more than just "our team", while also reaping the same efficiency benefits from other products and teams. The goal is to stop reinventing the wheel, at every program and station, to work together more, and to share technology.</p>
        <p>We are in the process of formulating what topics to focus on for this meetup. Please use contact form below to give us suggestions!</p>
