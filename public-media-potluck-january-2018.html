        <h1>Public Media Potluck - January 2018 Logistics</h1>
        <p>Build the next generation of Public Media together at the two day "Public Media Potluck". Share ideas, projects, and stories of success and failure with different public media product teams from around the country. Have a bigger impact by tackling issues facing public media organizations of all sizes and types of digital sophistication. This collective, coordinated effort will ensure you're solving problems that benefit more than just "our team", while also reaping the same efficiency benefits from other products and teams. The goal is to stop reinventing the wheel, at every program and station, to work together more, and to share technology.<br/><br/>If you'd like to contact the team organizing the Potluck, the best way to do that is via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/JTtFNbSduotdHGhj2">this form</a>.</p>

          <p>KPCC’s offices are in Pasadena, which is conveniently located if you want to check out the city or what the rest of LA has to offer.</p>
          <p>Sticking to this side of town, Old Town Pasadena is a 15 minute walk from the station and has two great independent coffee shops and some decent restaurants.</p>
          <p>A 10 minute Lyft ride away is the Huntington Botanical Gardens (huntington.org) which is a must visit if you want to take advantage of the good weather and have a few hours to kill.</p>
          <p>If you’re willing to drive 20 minutes, you can get to the heart of the San Gabriel Valley, known for its vast array of Chinese restaurants. If you want to explore regional Chinese cuisine, this is where to do it.</p>
          <p>A 30 minute train ride on the Gold line will bring you into downtown LA, straight into a historic train station as well as many walkable spots like Grand Central Market (food hall), Chinatown, and Olvera Street.</p>
