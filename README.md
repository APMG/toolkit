# The Public Media Kitchen Toolkit

There is too much duplication of effort in public media product development. We can do a better job sharing practices and things we build for ourselves that could be useful to others. The Public Media Kitchen Toolkit is a collection of interesting things we're all working on. The intention is first to inform but over time move to direct collaboration.

The Toolkit itself is the `index.html` file in this repo that lists summaries and links to the respective project. The rules for listing things:

- If it is a link to software, the page linked to the project must clearly explain what the project is and how to use it.
- If it is instead a process or methodology, the link should clearly explain how it works.
- Even if the project is not readily extensible in it's current form, it should be a project open for collaboration.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the above terms.
